Description: It is the Console-Based Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and additional mathematical functions in a user-friendly console environment. The calculator processes user input, evaluates expressions, and provides accurate results with error handling and history tracking.
Features: (Basic Arithmetic Operations) Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
(Mathematical Functions) Power(base, exponent), sqrt(number), abs(number), round(number) (rounds the number to the nearest integer).
Has expression parsing, history feature.
Challenges: (Error Handling) Detecting invalid expressions and providing error messages was challenging.
